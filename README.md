# Spotify True Shuffle - Frontend

Spotify's built-in shuffle can sometimes feel repetitive and predictable, pushing certain tracks more frequently than others. **True Shuffle** aims to provide a better shuffle experience by creating custom playlists with a truly randomised order of tracks.

This repository contains the frontend for the **Spotify True Shuffle** project, built with React. It allows users to shuffle their playlists on Spotify in a way that enhances the randomness of track order, providing a more enjoyable listening experience.

For the backend of the project, check out the [backend repository here](https://github.com/This-Is-Ko/spotify-true-shuffle).

- **Custom Playlist Management**: Keep your original playlist intact while creating a shuffled copy that you can delete anytime.
